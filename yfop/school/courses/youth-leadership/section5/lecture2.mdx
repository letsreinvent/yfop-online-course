### INTRODUCTION

Just like our body, our mind can be trained to develop a growth mindset. We do not need to be stuck in one point of view. In this module, we will uncover the correlation between your thoughts and your emotions and how it affects your behaviour.  This will be important as to how you can channel your emotions and actions into something truly positive that it very critical in trying to influence others to bring change.

### OBJECTIVE

This module will give you mind training tips on how to develop a growth mindset and explain why having a growth mindset is important to boost your creativity and unlock more potential.

### SUMMARY

#### What is a mindset?

A mindset is your mental framework comprised of your thoughts, value system, and your failures (thought + emotion = behavior). Our personality is a direct reflection of our mindset, including our ability to learn new things and experience the world through different perspectives.

There are two kinds of mindset, fixed and growth.

**Fixed mindset**
- The notion that your characteristics are innate
- No room for growth or margin of error
- "I'm not going to try because it will only lead to failure."

**Growth mindset**
- The principle that your abilities and intelligence are able to         develop (e.g. social skills)
- It can be perfected overtime
- "I can become better and do well through practice."

#### Mind Training

Mindset is key to reaching your maximum potential. Changing your way of thinking is key to achieving growth and developing your character. It is important to understand that a fixed mindset can be changed through mind training.

Mind training is the ability to get your brain into shape through a series of powerful daily habits, rituals and mantras that take you out of your old pattern of unsuccessful behavior. It will help you get into a new pattern of success that's in line with your goals, visions, and dreams. 

You can effectively form powerful habits or power habits by dividing them into three quadrants: for your mind, for your body, and for your spirit. Here are some examples of effective mind training practices:
-**Calm sandwich** - Powerful routines in the morning and at night allows for clarity and calmness throughout your day; creating a calm sandwich. You are calm in the morning, you have a flurry of activities to do throughout the day, and then you are calm at night. It also makes you resilient and able to make major or high-impact decisions based on rational judgments rather than your emotions or whatever is presented to you in that moment.
-**Positive autosuggestion** or self-talk would mean programming your mind by using positive and encouraging words to yourself. The same way as how negative thoughts can influence our emotions and behavior, being able to redirect our subconscious will allow us to be the best version of ourselves.

#### Why your Creativity Needs Growth Mindset

In order to be truly creative, one needs to have an expansive view of the world. This is possible by having a growth mindset. Believing that your abilities, creative skills, and talents can be developed and refined and so, the more creative you get, the more adaptive you become.  The  benefits of having a growth mindset are the following:

- Self-awareness
- Flexibility
- Risk-taking 
- Open-mindedness
- Freedom

The best way to assess yourself is through some self-reflective time. 

Ask yourself the following questions:
- Who am I? 
- How do people see me? 
- How do I want to be seen? 

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Having the right mindset is key to achieving growth and developing your potential. You can do this through mind training. You can also get your brain into good shape through powerful habits and affirmative mantras.
- Mind training does not only exercise your mind but also make use of your body and spirit. All three are essential in finding balance and stability. 
- Creativity requires having a growth mindset. Creativity is improved through cumulative effort and a growth mindset. It will give your a desire to learn, help you discover opportunities, embrace challenges, and learn from criticisms. 

### CHANGEMAKER CHALLENGE

- **Beginner:** “Be bold, be brave for your tomorrow is waiting on your choice today”. Write down your thoughts and translate them into 20 positive affirmations. Make sure to also put them into actions in order to manifest your intentions.
- **Intermediate:** Create a set of your own AM and PM power habits. Try it out for a week. Did it change your mindset or improve your productivity? Track your progress with a daily planner! 

**AM Power Habits** 
- ☐ Gratitude
- ☐ Reflection

**PM Power Habits**
- ☐ Gratitude
- ☐ Reflection

- **Advanced:** Experiment on how you translate your thoughts. Being alone with your own thoughts is not the most relaxing experience and it is important to be able to handle intense train of thoughts. Try creating an illustration of your thoughts instead of writing it down. Let your creativity run wild! Hang it on the wall in your room or post it on your fridge door to remind yourself that it is okay to let your thoughts run wild from time to time.
