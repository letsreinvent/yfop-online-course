Welcome to Youth for Our Planet’s online Path of the Changemaker Course where you will deepen your knowledge, hone your skills, and receive the tools necessary to be an equipped changemaker for your community. 

To begin, read through the Changemaker Identities below and choose the one that feels the most like you. Each Changemaker Identity includes a curated set of modules designed especially for your changemaker type with complimentary worksheets and Changemaker Challenges to put your learning into action. 

**The Advocate:** If you are passionate about political activism or are seeking to reach decision-makers to encourage them to act on behalf of people and planet, then you will complete Modules number 3, 12, and 15.

**The Entrepreneur:** If you are keen to come up with new ideas to solve problems and like turning ideas for projects, programmes and campaigns into reality, then you will complete Modules number 4, 16, 17.

**The Mobilizer:** If you are looking to build support for a cause in a physical or online community and give people direction and inspiration, then you will complete Modules number 5, 13, 14.

**The Influencer:** If you are leading by example and enjoy curating a platform that broadens your circle of influence through social media or social campaigns, then you will complete Modules number 7, 8, 10.

**The Supporter:** If you want to contribute by bringing your skills and energy to an existing project to maximise impact, then you will complete Modules number 1, 6, 11.

**The Shaper:** If you love getting your hands dirty and enjoy making changes directly through on the ground work, then you will complete Modules number 2 and 9.

Each of us are made up of a combination of changemaker traits, which is what makes us unique and dynamic! Once you complete one changemaker journey, come back to complete a new set of modules and learn from other global leaders. All modules are designed to provide the foundation for overall skills development and knowledge building. The more modules you complete the bigger your changemaker toolbox will be!
