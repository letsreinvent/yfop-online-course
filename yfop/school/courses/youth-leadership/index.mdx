    Welcome to Youth for Our Planet’s online course, Path of the Changemaker, where you will deepen your knowledge, hone your skills, and receive the tools necessary to be an equipped changemaker for your community.

    To begin, read through the Changemaker Identities below and choose the one that feels the most like you. You will be expected to complete watching the videos, answering the questionnaire on each module and the reflection questions at the end of course. You can also download the worksheet for further resources and call to action.

    Please note that the modules are grouped by type of Changemaker Identity and the certificates will be generated according to the Changemaker Identity path taken.

    Each Changemaker Identity includes a curated set of modules designed especially for your changemaker type with complimentary worksheets and Changemaker Challenges to put your learning into action.

    Each of us are made up of a combination of changemaker traits, which is what makes us unique and dynamic! Once you complete one changemaker journey, come back to complete a new set of modules and learn from other global leaders. All modules are designed to provide the foundation for overall skills development and knowledge building. The more modules you complete the bigger your changemaker toolbox will be!
