This course will provide resources for 6 different types of Changemaker Identity. You can either go through all the modules for all changemaker identities or just focus on completing the videos and activities outlined under a changemaker identity section.

Remember all modules are designed to provide the foundations for skills development and knowledge building in whichever changemaker identity you decide to choose so we definitely encourage you to check them all out!
