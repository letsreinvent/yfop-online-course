### INTRODUCTION

Change is within you. In this module, we will be exploring what it means to be a changemaker by assessing your leadership personality through a DISC test. We will also find the ways on how you can embrace change through 360 Feedback gathering and giving constructive feedback. Lastly, we will explore how you can lead change by creating your own Theory of Change.

### OBJECTIVE

The content of this module will help you identify your own leadership personality. It also aims to make you a more resilient and strong leader by embracing change through receiving and giving feedback. You will learn how feedback can help you grow as a changemaker, allowing you to get a headstart.

### SUMMARY

#### Your Changemaker Identity

It’s crucial for you to have a better understanding of who you are as a person and leverage your unique identity and personality. This will allow you to find the types of activities that suit your leadership style and approaches. Being flexible and being self-aware will help you become a better, stronger and a more resilient leader!

#### The DISC Personality test instructions:

There are 24 rows of words to describe you and each row will have 4 words. Your task is to choose or circle the word, among the words under columns A, B, C and D per row, that best describes you.

3- Willing / Animated / Bold / Precise <br />
4- Argumentative / Doubting / Indecisive / Unpredictable <br />

23- Dependent / Flighty / Stoic / Pushy <br />
24- Tolerant / Conventional / Stimulating / Directing <br />

#### DISC Profile

Let’s find out the results! If you select the column A word in the first row (Restrained)- find and circle where letter A is in the DISC sheet. Tip: it is under ‘S’. 

Now, do this for every row.

Match your answers to this table!

D / I / S / C <br />
1- B / D / A / C <br />
2- A / C / D / B <br />
3- C / B / A / D <br />
4- A / D / C / B <br />
5- D / B / C / A <br />
6- B / A / D / C <br />
7- C / D / B / A <br />
8- B / A / D / C <br />
9- D / A / C / B <br />
10- C / B / D / A <br />
11- A / D / C / B <br />
12- D / C / A / B <br />
13- B / A / D / C <br />
14- C / D / B / A <br />
15- D / A / C / B <br />
16- A / B / C / D <br />
17- B / C / D / A <br />
18- C / A / B / D <br />
19- D / B / C / A <br />
20- A / D / C / B <br />
21- A / B / C / D <br />
22- D / C / B / A <br />
23- D / B / A / C <br />
24- D / C / A / B <br />

Now, add up the total per column D, I, S, C!

*DISC represents:*

**D stands for Dominance** <br />
If your results show that you are Dominant, you are extroverted and outgoing and task-oriented. You tend to be more direct, decisive, and driven. Typically you have high confidence, self-motivated, and are comfortable taking risks. 

**I stands for Influence** <br />
If your results show that you are Influential, you are likely to be extroverted, outgoing, and people-oriented. You are most likely to be inspiring, impressionable, interactive, and involved. You like to engage others in conversation and tend to be popular because of your social skills and charm.

**S stands for Steadiness** <br />
If your results show that you are Steady, it can mean that you are more introverted and reserved, and people-oriented. You are typically calm, easy-going, and collected. You like supporting and collaborating with people and you work hard to ensure that the team is in harmony and balance.

**C stands for Conscientiousness** <br />
If your results show that you are Conscientious, you are someone who is more introverted and reserved and tends to be cautious, and careful. Typically, you are analytical, detail-oriented, and intentional. You are inquisitive and make sure that everything is working the way it should.

If you feel that the results are not accurate about your personality, that’s okay! The most important lesson here is leadership is expected to be flexible to different situations and different stakeholders or different outcomes! 

#### Embracing Change

My top 3 tips on how you can effectively embrace change:

- **360 Feedback gathering:** Feedback is important because it allows you to be aware of what has to change for you to improve on your work, your relationships and the ways you can work with different kinds of people on different initiatives. Your goal is to recognise the importance of giving constructive feedback but more importantly, receiving them fully so you can act on your own improvement journey.
- **Providing Constructive Feedback:** By providing constructive feedback, you are also enabling others to improve and understand where exactly they fall short. As a leader, it is in your best interest to help your fellows to work with them to identify their strengths and points for improvement. This is a more sustainable way of empowering others to be changemakers and encourage leadership from the younger generation.
- **Embrace Learning Development:** Being open and receptive to change means, not being afraid to explore the new possibilities of how to incorporate technology to create positive impacts in our life and society. It also means that we need to keep being curious and be vigilant to make sure that we aren’t neglecting our responsibilities of taking care of our planet.

#### Leading Change

A theory of change is a description of why a particular way of working will be effective, showing how change happens in the short, medium and long term to achieve your intended impact. It can be represented in a visual diagram, as a narrative, or both.

A theory of change is usually developed when you start an initiative to help with strategic planning, or to describe an existing project so you can evaluate it. You should also have a deeper understanding of who your stakeholders are - this may mean your staff, volunteers, trustees, beneficiaries, partners, collaborators, funders and many others.

In practice, a theory of change should be:

- **Credible** – this will be based on previous experience and insight from your different stakeholders or relevant research where appropriate
- **Achievable** – you have the necessary resources to carry out the intervention
- **Supported** – your stakeholders will be involved in defining and agreeing your theory of change, which builds support for it
- **Testable** –  a complete but not over-complicated description of your work and its outcomes, with prioritised outcomes for measurement and indicators to collect data against them

### CHANGEMAKER CHALLENGE

- **Beginner:** Arrange to collect your own 360 Feedback!

**Step 1:** Use any of these free online forms which you can create to facilitate getting feedback: Google Forms, Type Form, SurveyMonkey or Airtable. Alternatively, you can use a paper-based survey! 

You can list down questions or ask specific feedback about a particular skillset, knowledge or personality you want to improve on or develop. For example, but not limited to:
- Rate/describe my leadership skills
- Rate/describe my presentation skills
- Am I effective at communicating my vision to others?
- Am I effective at managing my relationships with colleagues?
- Do I seem to be present when in meetings? 

**Step 2:** Select your responders/raters. This could be your friends, family, work colleagues, clients, project participants or other people whom you think should comment on your work and as a leader so you know exactly what to improve on.

**Step 3:** Send out the survey link and collect their feedback. You might want to anonymise their identity so it remains confidential and they would feel much more open to share their thoughts. You can also set a deadline if you want to carve an a dedicated time to generate the results and to analyse them.

**Step 4:** Generate Reports. This could be by  downloading the excel or csv file from the online form or it could mean, collating of the results if you did the 360 feedback survey via pen and paper. Try to group the answers to each question and highlight any patterns or remarkable comments. Also be mindful of the particular situations where your responder has also provided points for improvement, this will be a quick win for you.

**Step 5:** Reflect on Results. This is entirely personal. How do you respond to these opportunities to change? Would you address them one by one and map out the concrete steps to address them? Remember, try not to take everything personally- this exercise is for you to obtain objective suggestions for improvement! See this as a learning opportunity rather than a personal attack or criticism.

- **Intermediate:** Providing Feedback

Remember, it is not always easy to receive feedback so be very careful when setting your tone and your intention. 

**Step 1:** Try to start the conversation with the person whom you would like to provide feedback for by stating first the positive points. It gives the other person the impression that you are being respectful, objective and acknowledging the positive elements of an activity or work.  

**Step 2:** Outline the points for improvement in a very constructive, respectful and specific manner. The more concrete the point is, the clearer it will be for the other to work on addressing the actions/point to focus improving on

**Step 3:** End the feedback by reaffirming your positive intentions for improvement. Try this structure a few more times until you feel much more comfortable. If you want to go on the extra mile and offer further support depending on the context of the situation, offer ideas, resolutions or alternative ways to correct an issue. 

By providing constructive feedback, you are also enabling others to improve and understand where exactly they fall short. As a leader, it is in your best interest to help your fellows to work with them. Help them to identify their strengths and points for improvement. This is a more sustainable way of empowering others to be changemakers and encourage leadership from the younger generation.

- **Advanced:** Create your own Theory of Change! If you are ready to effect a massive change within your organisation or community, this challenge is for you!

#### Steps to Create Your Theory of Change

### REFLECTION CORNER

After watching the video of the module, we encourage you to think, reflect and learn about the following questions:
- Do you consider yourself as a leader? What kind of leader do you want to be?
- Have you received any feedback for self-improvement from friends, family, colleagues lately? How did it make you feel? 
- Have you consciously given someone a constructive feedback? How did they react to it?
