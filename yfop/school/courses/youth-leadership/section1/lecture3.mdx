### INTRODUCTION

Setting a goal is easy, but reaching it could be a challenge especially if you are unsure which actions we need to take. 

In this module, we will talk about how you can reach your goal through the changemaker journey map, visualising your goal and analysing the feasibility of your goal through the SMART criterias, and identifying the steps you need to take to reach your goal.

### OBJECTIVE

The aim of this module is to guide you in your changemaker journey through a series of self-reflection and visualization of your goals. This will help you realize the steps you need to take to become a changemaker and why those steps are crucial in your changemaker journey. This will also challenge you to grow and move outside your comfort zone to discover new things and develop your skills to reach your goals.

### SUMMARY

#### **Changemaker Journey Map**

A changemaker journey map is a step-by-step guide that will lead you to become a changemaker. It shows you what significant steps you need to take in your changemaker journey.

In this lecture, we have identified 4 points to become a changemaker: Spark, Step, Statement, and Shape.
- **Spark** - the spark is your reason or inspiration why you want to become a changemaker. It could be a problem you have identified in your community, being inspired by people around you, or your passion.
- **Step** - step is your first action. After you have identified your spark, you need to take a step to create answers or solutions to the problem.
- **Statement** - these are the statements or words of affirmation and encouragement. These might come from your families, your friends, or anyone impacted by your action. These validations will serve as an inspiration for you to continue with your journey.
- **Shape** - this is the stage where you design a concrete solution to address the problem. You can build or expand your team and work on fundraising activities or other methods to raise funds for your project.

#### Visualising Your Goal

Setting a goal is important in your changemaker journey. It gives you a visual of what your future might look like. It also gives you a sense of motivation knowing you have somewhere to be. In this lecture we have identified the characteristics of a good goal through the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound) criteria.

- **Specific** - a goal should be well defined and clear. It should answer the 5 Ws question. What is to be accomplished? Where should the goal be achieved? When do you want to achieve your goal? Who is involved? And why do you want to achieve your goal?
- **Measurable** - a good goal should be measurable. It should allow you to recognise whether you are making a progress or not. It answers the questions: How many? How much? And how will I know if I succeed in my goal?
- **Attainable** - in setting a goal, you should make sure that it is achievable or attainable given the resources you have at hand.
- **Relevant** - a good goal must be relevant to your other goals and long-term plan. This point is to ensure that the identified goal matters to you.
- **Time-bound** - a good goal must be time bound so that you will have your deadline and know what you should be focusing on.

#### Identifying the steps to reach your goal
Setting a goal is important as well as identifying the steps how you can reach your goal. The steps to reach your goal are relative to what your goal is because different goals requires different skills. Nonetheless, in this lecture, we have identified a general rule as to how you can reach your goal.

First is to work on your mindset. Having a positive mindset towards your goal because you need to be confident and decisive about your ideas. Second is to determine the skills you need to reach your goal. And third, develop the skills you need to reach your goal.

You can develop your skills through classes, taking part in community activities or even volunteering in organisations with the same goal as yours. It will not only hone your skills but also give you new ideas and perspective.
