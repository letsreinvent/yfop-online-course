### INTRODUCTION

In this module we will discuss about you can incorporate environmental sustainability into your personal brand. 

### OBJECTIVE

The content of this module will help you understand what personal branding entails as an overall concept, what topics are associated with it and what activities contribute to building your personal brand. This also aims to raise awareness on the environment using the power of your brand.

### SUMMARY

#### My Brand

Discovering what you know and what you’re good at or what you could be good at, are key steps in knowing your personal brand. This image that you project to the world is very important.

The opportunities out there are endless but the opportunities that will be relevant to you will be dependent on how people see you. You don’t always = have to actively find opportunities. Through creating a strong brand in line with your values, ethics, and vision, opportunities often will find their way to you.

Be an expert in a thing or two. The reason why your brand is linked to your skills is because of the value it adds to them. People come to you for help and guidance for your knowledge and expertise of these things.

Leaving that mark on others will be critical to make them vouch for you or recommend you to people and their networks. 

#### How to Develop My Personal Brand

To continue to stay relevant in a world that is constantly changing and evolving while also remaining true to yourself and what you believe, continually refining and considering your personal brand is important.

Your skills and abilities are your strengths so before finding out what else you could do, focus on what you already can do. It’s the awareness that can turn your skills into strengths. 

When you already have an idea of what you want to be known for, define your audience. You will find great support in your audience. They will become your followers and they will vouch for you. 

Networking, be it in person or online, will play an important part in building your personal brand. If you haven’t done so, start building your network through your audience. Things will be easier for you to build a presence.

**Top tips to grow your network:**

- **Join groups:** it can be via community-organised groups or even Facebook groups! This will give you a good head start.
- **Proactively reach out to people:** There’s no harm in reaching out and chances are, people will be more than willing to help you! Highly recommend to reach out via Linkedin or even by just tagging people on social media or sliding through their direct messages!

#### Me, My Brand, and the Environment

Finding purpose in everything that you do can give you a sense of fulfillment as an individual. It also gives you a sense of mission when you know that what you are doing can have a massive impact on society and the planet.

**The Youth’s Role:** A critical element in shaping the future of our planet. Youth needs to take a solid stand in tackling climate issues to ensure a safe planet for the future. You need to start maximising your influence in favour of causes such as the environment. 

**Environmental awareness:** To raise awareness regarding a certain issue or promote positive change, we need to start through education. As young people you have access to a lot of information that can be very useful in terms of providing you with knowledge about the environment.

**Initiative Building:** Start involving yourself in community initiatives or any environmental project. This could be available through local councils, universities and even places of work. Take it a step further and organise your own initiative! You already have a support system. Use your platform to forward your environmental advocacy.

### KEY TAKEWAYS

- To realise your personal brand you have to know your skills, talents and abilities first and embrace them.
- Turn these talents and skills into strengths that people will want to seek your guidance for.
- Identifying your audience means building yourself a support structure and system.
- Networking is a key element in developing your personal brand.
- Advocating for change means using your platform to fight for causes that you relate to including the environment.

### CHANGEMAKER CHALLENGE

- **Beginner:** Take a look to the #30Days4theClimate Campaign, select 5 challenges that you want to commit for the next month and share it with your friends and family. You can submit your commitments at Count Us In and track your progress. Don’t forget to share it with us by tagging with the hashtag, #LeadforOurPlanet
- **Intermediate:** Turn your commitments into a reality! It may be a behavioral change, the way we influence others, and/or by setting a good example in response to the environmental movement.
-**Advanced:** Actively search within your network for mentors or organisations who can help you with your first environmental gig. Become an active member in various communities on environmental action. Add your new contacts in your social network, connect with them all actively and propose ideas or projects that everyone can get involved in. 

Take action and share that action with others!

### REFLECTION CORNER

After watching the video of the module, we encourage you to think, reflect and learn about the following questions:
- Which personalities do you know who have used their platforms to advocate for environmental sustainability?
- Change starts from within before you can influence others. Do you think you can already influence your family (and friends) on their opinion on the environment?
